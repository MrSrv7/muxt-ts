# MUXT-TS

[muxt-ts](https://github.com/MrSrv7/muxt) is a NextJS app built with Typescript and MUI based on [HPouyanmehr](https://github.com/HPouyanmehr/muxt-ts)'s repository but with ReactJS's **useContext** API to provide the context to the application globally. In this application, we will implement the context for theming where the user can toggle the themes (light/dark) with useContext's actions and getters.

## Getting Started

First, clone the project.

```bash
HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/MrSrv7/muxt-ts-context.git
# or
SSH: git clone git@github.com:MrSrv7/muxt-ts-context.git
```

Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font automatically.
